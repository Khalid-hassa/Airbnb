# Airbnb EDA Project 

Project Overview

This project perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on Airbnb New York 2024 dataset to uncover trends and patters for business problems. This projects includes several data analysis techniques and libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Seaborn and techniques like data cleaning, feature enginerring, data visualization and analysis.

Dataset

The dataset contains 20,765 entries and 22 features.

1. Data Cleaning
Handle missing data: price, neighborhood, and beds columns had null values.
Fix data types: Converted last_review to a datetime object.
Remove outliers: Listings with prices > $1,000 were capped to avoid skewed visualizations.
2. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Room type distribution:

Visualized the count of each room type using bar plots.
Identified Entire home/apt as the most common room type.
Neighborhood group insights:

Analyzed price variations by boroughs.
Manhattan had the highest average prices.
Availability trends:

Used heatmaps to show correlations among price, availability_365, number_of_reviews, and beds.
Price distribution:

Used histograms to show the distribution of prices.
Majority of the listings were priced between $50 - $300.
Host listings:

Analyzed hosts with multiple listings using boxplots to identify key contributors.
Review behavior:

Used pair plots to show relationships between number of reviews, price, and availability.
3. Data Visualization
Pairplot: To see correlations among price, availability, and number of reviews.
Heatmap: Showing correlations among numerical features.
Histograms and Boxplots: To detect outliers in price.
Bar Charts: Displaying room types and neighborhood group distributions.

Conclusion

This project offers valuable insights into the New York Airbnb market, helping both guests and hosts make informed decisions. By using EDA techniques, we identified key trends and developed actionable recommendations. Future improvements can involve advanced analytics and predictive modeling to further enhance the findings.
